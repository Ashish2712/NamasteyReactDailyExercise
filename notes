Bundler - codes needs to be minified, cleaned
webpack,babel, parcel, weed - all these are bundlers, it bundles our app and ship it to the production.

types of dependencies
1. Dev - required only while developing the product
2. Normal - required normally, during production

^2.11.0 -> carrot sign is used to auto upgrade the version of the module
~2.11.0 -> It will install the major version of the module automatically

so putting carrot sign helps you not to auto upgrade to major version.

transitive dependencies -> one module is dependent on other modules is termed as transitive dependency.

npm - calling the command of npm, which is a package manager
npx - to execute the package
how does a package is executed ?
Ex: npx parcel index.html -> here parcel ignite the app by running server on localhost

cdn links is not a good way to bring react in your project, as it requires network call to the cdn network
and bring the react to your project, instead of having react as modules in your local system is a prefered way.

browser scripts cannot have imports or exports -> put type="module" inside script tag in index.html

# Parcel
- Dev build
- Local server
- HMR - Hot module replacement
- File watching algorithm, written in C++
- faster build - because of caching inside .parcel-cache
- Image optimization
- Minification
- Bundling
- Compress
- Diagnostic
- Error Handling
- HTTPS
- Tree Shaking - remove unused code 
- Different Dev and Prod bundles
https://parceljs.org/docs/ 

Main  in package.json is responsible for entrypoint in the app.

when you run npx parcel index.html
parcel creates the file inside dist folder now everytime when you save parcel get's the file
from .parcel-cahce using HMR(Hot module replacement)

npx parcel build index.html -> command to build production build


JSX -> Javascript syntax to create react elemenet
----------------------------------
Creating food delivery app - first design the wireframe/Mock plan things what needs to
be present on the page

to dynamically data to a component will pass using props
config driven UI -> UI is driven by config(ex: based on the location UI will change)

why we need unique keys in react
to optimise the re-rendering of react, react needs to uniquely identify them using the key

using index as Id is not recommended way, but best practice is to use a unique id.
