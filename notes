Bundler - codes needs to be minified, cleaned
webpack,babel, parcel, weed - all these are bundlers, it bundles our app and ship it to the production.

types of dependencies
1. Dev - required only while developing the product
2. Normal - required normally, during production

^2.11.0 -> carrot sign is used to auto upgrade the version of the module
~2.11.0 -> It will install the major version of the module automatically

so putting carrot sign helps you not to auto upgrade to major version.

transitive dependencies -> one module is dependent on other modules is termed as transitive dependency.
